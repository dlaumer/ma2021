            I'm Daniel and in the scope of my master thesis, I developed a web app called UrbanMobility. 
            It is a tool to visualize information like traffic and public transport in an urban 
            environment in an interactive web application. <br><br>
            
            The usage of the app is exemplified on a concrete project of the city of Zurich: The 
            Rosengartentunnel and Tram. The plan is to build a semicircular tunnel in order to 
            relieve a heavily frequented road segment of around 700m in the middle of the city. 
            The original road should be scaled down and provide space for two new tram lines.<br><br>

            The project was rejected by the public vote in Spring 2020. Itâ€™s interesting because 
            it was quite controversial and the public opinion changed a lot over time. The 
            initiative combined the tunnel and the tram, which was a clever move because it 
            attracted both sides of the mobility camps. Nevertheless it faced a lot of opposition 
            from the public and the green parties. Other arguments against it were the imense costs 
            of 1.1 Billion Swiss Francs.<br>
            Imagine that time is turned back and we are now again shortly before the public vote 
            and You are trying to inform yourself about the project. <br><br>
 
            UrbanMobility is the answer for that: It shows the current and future situation as 
            well as indicators like how many cars are on the road and how many free spaces there 
            are on the public transport. In the following tasks you will answer some specific quesitions 
            about the mobility situation and learn more about the project.
