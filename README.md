Master Thesis Daniel Laumer Spring 2021

# Content
This applicaton was developed in the scope of a master thesis at ETH Zurich and in collaboration with Esri R&D Center Zurich. 
It is a tool called UrbanMobility to visualize information like traffic and public transport in an urban environment in an interactive web application.

# Abstract
This thesis explores the integration of mobility data in a web-based three-dimensional environment. Mobility information like number of passengers on public transport or the amount of cars on the road is still rather new to 3D visualizations. This work tackles the challenge of finding possible visualization techniques for such mobility metrics and investigates their suitability and performance. Additionally, the resulting 3D symbolizations are compared to a similar 2D approach and the difference in performance and experience is measured. The goal is to define a concrete use case and develop a prototype, which is then used to conduct a user study. This study measures the usability of the prototype and answers the research questions defined in the beginning. <br />
The use case defined for this thesis is a web-based application for the Rosengartentunnel project, a major mobility undertaking in the city of Zurich and the subject of a recent public vote. The vision is to build a platform where citizens can inform themselves and form an educated opinion. <br />
During the course of the thesis, a prototype for such an application called UrbanMobility was developed. It was built in two different versions (2D and 3D) and contained two different visualization techniques for mobility flow data, either using the visual variable color or size. The prototype was then tested in the form of a within-subject user study with 83 participants. The user study was also implemented from scratch and designed to be conducted without external supervision. <br />
The study yielded several interesting results. When comparing the two visual variables color and size, size always outperformed color. The difference was even more significant in the 2D version. When comparing 2D vs. 3D, a major discovery is that objective measures like success rate or task completion time do not indicate a significant difference. Nevertheless, the subjective experience differs between the two versions: The participants deemed the 3D version to be more attractive and stimulating, but also stated that it is more demanding to operate.
